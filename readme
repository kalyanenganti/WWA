This is a coding test  for the Who'sWhoApp that I had given for 'The App Business'.I have tried to program the
app based on the user acceptance tests defined.The app supports android os versions 8 upto 17.
To make the task easier.I have used the jsoup and the universal image loader libraries.
The link to the image with the rounded shape was not working.I have made a crude fix for the same
using a transparent circle with a white background masking the image.The activity does not have a 
table header as described in the coding instructions.
